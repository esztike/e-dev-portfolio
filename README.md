# `<e>` // e-dev-portfolio

This repository contains my MIT xPRO portfolio project.  
The site is a simple, static HTML/CSS portfolio built for coursework, documenting my early web development practice.

## Repository Structure
The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, with all site files located in the `/docs` directory.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — semantic structure  
- **CSS3** — custom styling and layout  
- **Git/GitHub** — version control and deployment via GitHub Pages  

This project is a learning artifact and will evolve as I progress through the program.
