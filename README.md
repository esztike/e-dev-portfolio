# `<e>` // e-dev-portfolio

This repository is the central hub for my professional developer portfolio, designed to showcase the intersection of UX/DX Design and Full-stack Development.

## Repository Architecture
To maintain a clean system design, I have organized this repository with a modular structure:

* **Root Directory**: Contains the portfolio's primary pages (Home, About, Contact).
* **`/assets`**: Global media, branding, and the `<e>` favicon.
* **`/docs`**: Professional documentation and my Resume.
* **`/projects`**: Standalone project directories, each with its own logic and technical README.

## Technical Foundation
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility.
* **CSS3**: Custom variables and Flexbox/Grid systems.
* **Git/GitHub**: Version control and deployment via GitHub Pages.

*For a deep dive into the code logic of specific projects, please explore the `/projects` directory.*
