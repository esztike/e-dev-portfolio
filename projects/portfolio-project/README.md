# Case Study: Developer Portfolio Architecture

## 🎯 Objective
To translate a high-level personal design brand into a semantic, responsive codebase while practicing the discipline of clean folder separation and system architecture.

## Technical Implementation
### CSS Grid System: 
Engineered a responsive grid to handle "table-style" data for skills and project cards, ensuring visual precision across all device sizes.
### Semantic HTML5: 
Prioritized accessibility (A11y) by using meaningful tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) to ensure the site is as functional as it is aesthetic.
### Design-to-Code Efficiency: 
Applied modular CSS principles to mirror the design systems I developed in previous UX roles.

## Reflections
This project served as a deep dive into the "How" of web development. By owning the full lifecycle—from initial wireframe to final Git push—I have bridged the gap between designing a product and building its core logic.
